TITLE:Installation Instructions for Judge Eval System
AUTHORS:Maor Bernstein,Tian Zhang, and Wilson Burchenal
To install the JudgeEval system on an SCU Apache Website, simply copy judgeEval.tar.gz and install.sh into the directory that is assigned to your website (e.g. for Maor Bernstein this would be /webpages/mbernste/), and simply run install.sh on the destination server. Once this is complete, delete the install.sh file, and the website is working.
